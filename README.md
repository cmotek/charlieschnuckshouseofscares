# CHARLIE SCHNUCKS' HOUSE OF SCARES

This is horror movie blog website I am building. I'm just working on crafting the cover page right now. It's going to be a little old school analog style website with a point and click interface. I'm going to record a work journal here and try to be consistent.

I put together an initial logo look with GIMP (bewilderingly terrible name for a software) this evening. I'm surprised by how close I got to what's inside my head but I'm definitely going to redo it in order to clean up some of the edges on the images. It's a little analog and retro but that's fun, that's art. It's just a horror blog, I'm not worried about user authentification or having a shopping cart or whatever.

Create better background image in terms of shading. Will let this one fly. Not the best thing on the planet but still pretty good. I may try and do another version with better shading on the leaves, but I prefer the shading on the leaves and the skull on this one. Text placement is a little better on the previous one. Now to do research on pixelated backgrounds.
