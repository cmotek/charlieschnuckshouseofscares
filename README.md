# CHARLIE SCHNUCKS' HOUSE OF SCARES

This is horror movie blog website I am building. I'm just working on crafting the cover page right now. It's going to be a little old school analog style website with a point and click interface. I'm going to record a work journal here and try to be consistent.

I put together an initial logo look with GIMP (bewilderingly terrible name for a software) this evening. I'm surprised by how close I got to what's inside my head but I'm definitely going to redo it in order to clean up some of the edges on the images. It's a little analog and retro but that's fun, that's art. It's just a horror blog, I'm not worried about user authentification or having a shopping cart or whatever.

Create better background image in terms of shading. Will let this one fly. Not the best thing on the planet but still pretty good. I may try and do another version with better shading on the leaves, but I prefer the shading on the leaves and the skull on this one. Text placement is a little better on the previous one. Now to do research on pixelated backgrounds.

Built the charlie page, which of course, will be replaced with the actual website, but was good practice for how Flask uses routes to navigate between pages. The ultimate important thing about the updates for today is that I worked to harness the background image and the ENTER link for the website in the appropriate station. Now, I just have to create the ENTER image that I want to use instead of text and create the entry audio!?! for the website modeled off the title pages for Resident Evil.

LOL I got the ENTER image that I had in my mind for this. Desktop version still isn't responsive but I'll probably have to come up with a design for that. But this is hilariously close to what I had in my head for this. Now onward to audio.

Pixel art background is going to be difficult, difficult, difficult to do. And since I also plan on having the size of the website expand, I plan on scratching it and restarting anyways. Difficult, difficult. How will I get the look the I have in my head? 

I at least have located a castle image I can work from that fits basically what I would have in my find for the look of the website, although it will be a lot of work in order to shape it appropriately. Then I can add animated sprites that functions as different links to "rooms" of the "castle".
